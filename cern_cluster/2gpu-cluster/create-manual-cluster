1) ssh to head node on cern cluster (gpu-node1)

2) Run:
ray start --head  --node-ip-address=192.168.100.1 --port=6379
IP address needed because it will use wrong interface/address

3) ssh to worker node on cern cluster (gpu-node2)

4) Run:
ray start --address=192.168.100.1:6379

this tells node where to find head node, and correctly identifies the worker's local IP address as 100.2

5) Run:
ray status
to see that both nodes are active in cluster
